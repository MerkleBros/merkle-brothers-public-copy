                        <p>Players can introduce new cards and vote to alter the attributes of existing cards.</p>

                        <p>Merkle Bros is in the early stages of development. The main card game doesn’t exist yet.</p>

                          <p>Card instances are tokens owned by the player. These are generated randomly when players buy packs (or non-randomly if a player buys a promo card). Each instance has an associated ‘prototype’ that identifies the card. Each prototype represents a card blueprint that has been introduced into the game (either by the Merkle Bros team or by a community governance vote). Prototypes have the following attributes:</p>
                          <p>Prototype Id - A unique identifying number for this card blueprint</p>
                          <p>Set - The set this card belongs to</p>
                          <p>Rarity - Card rarity (common, rare, epic, or legendary)</p>
                          <p>Action Point Cost - Cost to play this card</p>
                          <p>Attack - Attack value (if card is a combatant)</p>
                          <p>Health - Health value (if card is a combatant)</p>
                          <p>Action One - Action that occurs when playing card</p>
                          <p>Action Two - There can be up to three unique actions when playing a card</p>
                          <p>Action Three</p>
                          <p>Action One Value - Value of the associated action that occurs when playing a card</p>
                          <p>Action Two Value</p>
                          <p>Action Three Value</p>
                          <p>Title - Name of the card</p>
                          <p>Artist - Artist associated with the card illustration</p>
                          <p>Community governance vote can modify the following attributes of a card prototype: action point cost to play, attack value, health value, card actions that occur when playing card, values associated with the actions that occur when playing card. Card title, artist, rarity, and set cannot be altered once created. Community governance can also vote to introduce new card prototypes to the game. </p>
                          <p>The card game will acquire card data directly from the smart contract.</p>

                        <p>When players complete a set, they can claim a ‘totem’ representing that set.</p>
                        <p>A totem allows the player to generate a random card from every set that has a shared rarity.</p>
                        <p>So completing a common set would unlock a common totem which can be used to generate a random card from every common set.</p>
                        <p>The collection game is intended to reward early players and to raise money for game development.</p>
                        <p>As new cards and sets are introduced, it will become harder for players to complete sets and unlock totems. Early players are rewarded with additional cards by completing sets while there are still a relatively small number of cards.</p>

                        <p>After purchasing a print, you will be asked to provide your name, email address, and mailing address so that we know where to send your print.</p>
                        <p>This process involves signing a Metamask message to prove ownership of your account and then submitting a form with your details.</p>
                        <p>You will receive an email update when the print run is complete and your print has been shipped.</p>
